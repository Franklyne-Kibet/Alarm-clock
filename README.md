# Alarm-clock 
The main purpose of this Python project is to develop an alarm clock.

## Prerequisites
This project uses Python and GUI (Graphic User Interface). Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.

Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. All the modules used need not be downloaded beforehand.

## Project File Structure

    a) Importing all the libraries and modules required
    b) Putting forward a while loop which takes the argument of the time, the user wants to set the alarm on and automatically breaks when the time is up, with sound.
